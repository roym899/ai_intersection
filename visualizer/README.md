To compile we used the Qt library 5.9.2 and Qtcreator. Though it probably works with older versions as well. Opening the project file and compiling should create a build-... folder from which the visualizer can be run using

> ./visualizer < sim.dat

sim.dat is the file output by the CSP approach (centralized folder).
