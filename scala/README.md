Here you can find the SAT implementation.

Some already generated simulations can be found in "cd ../satvis/simulationX.txt"

If you want to try to generate a solution by yourself, YOU FIRST NEED TO DECOMMENT LAST LINES IN Main.scala to see more detailed information about how the problem is solved.
Then open the project into a scala IDE (eg Eclipse for scala or Intelij)
- Specify the version of scala to be 2.11
- Go to "properties / Java Build Path / add external JARs " and look for the jar in lib/cafesat_2.11-0.01.jar
- Then you can launch the Main.

More specific information can be found at the beginning of Main.scala.
